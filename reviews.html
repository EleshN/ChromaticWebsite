        Chromatic is the best game I have ever played!

        Chromatic is a revolution of the metroidvania genre. It is the first to incorporate such well-constructed environmental themes.

        Chromatic is a great game and feels quite magical!

        I really enjoyed my time with Chromatic's demo, I loved using the bubble power and floating all around the stage! I can't wait to see what comes next.

        I enjoyed Chromatic, but it would have been better with more fish characters.

        Chromatic was an enjoyable experience, but there isn't a lot here yet. I would watch this site for future releases, but I don't think there's enough in this game right now that means you need to play it. Still, it makes for a fun 30 minutes!

        Chromatic is not finished yet and it shows.

        I have played too many other games like this. There is some fun stuff here but it doesn't break out of the mold of pixel art indie platformer.

        If you are like me and hate the color blue, this game is really not going to be your thing.
